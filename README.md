# Small-Projects
Just a small list of projects that I've made. Each took about 5 or 6 hours.

###Toontown_textbased.py
Small game that I made to submit to TTR staff to show off my python skills. Took about 6 hours. Fairly simple recreation of the Toontown battle system and Toontorial. Only have the toontorial stuff, will add more things later on, as well as a more complex battle system.

###terminal.py
Basic file explorer based on the command line. Made originally in 2013 but I fixed it up so it could be used on other computers and made some other minor optimizations.
